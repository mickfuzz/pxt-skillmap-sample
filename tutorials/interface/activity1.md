## Introduction @unplugged

**Are you ready to start coding your own platformer game**

This map will allow you to keep a track of your progress in making games. The idea of using the map to to help with:
- choosing what patterns to add your game
- finding the help you need to add those patterns
- keeping a track of your progress.
